# Banned Require
**You can prevent some NODEjs modules to be loaded in your JHS scripts**

There are two nodejs modules that you are not allowed to require (they are banned by default) in  a JHS script:
These are: require ('vm') and require ('jhs'). In addition, you can ban other modules too, 
by adding a list of names of modules to be banned in the options JSON, when you are creating 
a JHS instance in your server script.

 ```javascript 
    const options = {banned_require:['xx-node','lib-y','alt-z']};
    const execjhs = new JHS(options);
 ```
  in this example, node modules (even installed globally or locally in your project) 
  'xx-node','lib-y','alt-z' (along with 'vm' and 'jhs') are banned in the server. 
  That means, you require any of them in your JHS script, a server error will be thrown 
  (sent) when a webpage (dynamically generated by that JHS script) were requested .

Example: Assume the above list of banned modules is passed to your server. Then, the following JHS 
script, that you call 'e-1.jhs', will yield an error in the generated webpage: 
```javascript 
<?jhs
const liby = require('lib-y')
?>
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html><head><meta charset="utf-8"></head>
<body>
    <div style="text-align:center;">
        <h1><?jhs echo(liby()) ?></h1>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```
the resulted webpage will be:

```nunjucks
<html><head></head>
<body>
{error:true, file:'e-1.jhs', banned_require:'lib-y'};
</body>
</html>
```
the error page will be displayed even the alleged function 'liby()' 
is not called.
